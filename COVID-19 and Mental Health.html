                                Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has turned everyone’s lives upside down as what
will happen next. It has created turmoil and taken a toll on even the optimistic people who
were confident of what to do next and has planned for their future. Normal life has become a
question mark in this clueless pandemic situation. Added to the fear of contracting the virus
in a pandemic such as COVID-19 are the significant changes to our daily lives as our
movements are restricted in support of efforts to slow down the spread of the virus. Faced
with new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of
children, and lack of physical contact with other family members, friends, and colleagues;
makes it highly necessary to look after our mental and physical health.
                            </p>
                            <p>People are driven by stress, anxiety on one side and are going through depression due to
sudden loss of their loved one, their job, low wages, deduction of salary, unable to go back
to their native places, and even to meet their basic necessities as well. On the other hand,
people already suffering from anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and other forms of
chronic mental illness who are under treatment are some of the most vulnerable right now in
terms of being left alone or in isolation and having the potential for self-destructive behaviour
due to inconsistent support and a disrupted routine and hence lack of access to the
treatment.</p>
                            <p>
                               Various health organisations are concerned about this situation as how to address the
mental health issues and needs of the population. Even though many protocols have been
framed but still people find it difficult to follow the instructions and precautions as it affects
their daily routine life. The new normal has created a chaos in their lives.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Who are affected?</b><br>
Many people may have mental health concerns such as anxiety and depression during this
pandemic and their thoughts and feelings might change over time. Compared to patients
with negative COVID-19 test or COVID-19 symptoms, patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis
were more likely to experience a new onset of a mental health condition. Anxiety and major
depression were the most common type of mental health condition among patients,
regardless of whether they had a COVID-19 diagnosis or not.
Public health emergencies may affect the health, safety, and well-being of both individuals
(for example, insecurity, confusion, emotional isolation, and stigma) and communities (owing
to economic loss, work and school closures, inadequate resources for medical response,
and deficient distribution of necessities). These effects may translate into a range of
emotional reactions (such as distress or psychiatric conditions), unhealthy behaviors (such
as excessive substance use), and noncompliance with public health directives (such as
home confinement and vaccination) in people who contract the disease and in the general
population.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some groups may be more vulnerable than others to the psychosocial effects of pandemics.
In particular, people who contract the disease, those at heightened risk for it (including the
elderly, people with compromised immune function, and those living or receiving care in.<br>

What are some basic ways to practice self-care?<br>
⦿ Eat healthy foods<br>
⦿ Get enough sleep<br>
⦿ Move and Engage in physical activity<br>
⦿ Avoid tobacco, alcohol and drugs<br>
⦿ Limit screen time<br>
⦿ Relax and recharge<br>
⦿ Keep your regular routine<br>
⦿ Limit exposure to news media<br>
⦿ Plan your day and keep yourself busy<br>
⦿ Stay positive and focus on positive thoughts<br>
⦿ Set priorities<br>
⦿ Make connections<br>
⦿ Help others<br>
⦿ Cultivate hobbies<br>
⦿ Be mindful<br>
⦿ Regulate your emotions and learn how to
process them<br>
⦿ Practice gratitude and journaling<br>
⦿ Take time out to reflect on yourself<br>

congregate settings), are at increased risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes. Health care
providers are also particularly vulnerable to emotional distress in the current pandemic,
given their risk of exposure to the virus, concern about infecting and caring for their loved
ones, shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), longer work hours, and
involvement in emotionally and ethically fraught resource-allocation decisions.
Despite one’s best efforts, one might find himself/herself feeling helpless, sad, angry,
irritable, hopeless, anxious, or afraid. He/she may have trouble in concentrating on typical
tasks, changes in appetite, body aches and pains, or difficulty sleeping or may struggle to
face routine chores. They can also fall as a victim to compulsively checking the news often
and scrolling for something more definitive as what is happening around and becoming more
panic struck. If these signs and symptoms exists and last for several days in a row and make
you miserable and cause problems in your daily life to carry out normal responsibilities, then
it is time to ask for help. Considering the widening economic crisis and numerous
uncertainties surrounding this pandemic, suicidal ideation may emerge and necessitate
immediate consultation with a mental health professional or referral for possible emergency
psychiatric hospitalization. Many anxiety sufferers are prone to catastrophizing, which can
result in behaviours like panic buying or trying different medications and treatments to cure
or prevent COVID-19.

<p>
    <b>Prevention and Self-care practice</b><br>
Prevention efforts such as
screening for mental health
problems, psychoeducation, and
psychosocial support should focus
on the affected and other groups
at risk for adverse psychosocial
outcomes.
One of the important coping
strategies by the psychiatrists is to
feel the fear and identify what is
causing the fear and try to
alleviate it by taking a deep breath
and grounding yourself. Self-care
practices help us to maintain a
good health, fit body and peaceful
mind. Many of the experiences of
patients, family members, and the
public can be appropriately
normalized by providing
information about usual reactions
to this kind of stress and by
pointing out that people can and
do manage even during dire circumstances. Health care providers can offer suggestions for
stress management and coping (such as structuring activities and maintaining routines), link
patients to social and mental health services, and counsel patients to seek professional
mental health assistance when needed. Since media reports can be emotionally disturbing,

contact with pandemic-related news should be monitored and limited. Trying to limit the
media use and logging off all gadgets prior to 2hrs before sleep is highly essential. Many
parents commonly underestimate their children’s distress hence open discussions should be
encouraged to address children’s reactions and concerns. Talking to your loved ones
through virtual platforms and thus keeping social contact also provides psychological
support.
Health care systems needs to address the concerns of the health care providers by regular
monitoring systems, framing schedules, if needed alter the schedules and creating a positive
environment that offers psychosocial support required. For a long run, health system leaders
and health care professionals should be provided education and training regarding the
psychosocial issues that arise especially during the pandemic and disaster situations.
Your current strong feelings may fade when the pandemic is over, but stress will not
disappear from your life when the health crisis of COVID-19 ends. Continue these self-care
practices to take care of your mental and physical health and increase your ability to cope
with life&#39;s ongoing challenges. Despite all the challenges we are facing during this COVID-
19, it maybe physical, psychological, social, financial; we still have our own purpose and
goals in our life to live and move way forward with positivity. Stay strong and face the
situation. Focus on what you can control and accept what you cannot change. Adapt and
adjust to the new normal life. When we are nourished in mind, body, and spirit, we have
more of ourselves to offer to the world.</p>
